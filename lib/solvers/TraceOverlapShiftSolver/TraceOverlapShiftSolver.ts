/**
 * This solver finds traces that overlap (coincident and parallel) and aren't
 * connected via the globalConnMap, then shifts them to avoid the overlap in
 * such a way that minimizes the resulting intersections
 *
 * All traces are orthogonal, so for traces to be considered overlapping, they
 * need to each have a segment where both are horizontal or both are vertical
 * AND the segments must be within 1e-6 of each other in X (if vertical) or
 * Y (if horizontal)
 *
 * Each iteration, we find overlapping traces that aren't part of the same net.
 * This is the same as finding two "trace net islands" that have an overlap.
 *
 * We then consider all the possible ways to shift the overlapping traces to
 * minimize the intersections. If there are multiple trace segments within the
 * same net island they shift together.
